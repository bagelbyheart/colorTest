# Sci fi twine

## Key Ideas

* Trippy end of universe sci fi
* Stopping heat death by maintaining one point
* Was it right to stop heat death?  
  * was new universe the wrong move?
  * can old universe know if new works?
  * is this just extending the inevitable?  
    * is each internal universe a kindled flame dark souls?
	
## Structural ideas

* 4 sections of building
* Each section has 3 "unlocks"  
  * if I feel ambitious these can be puzzles
  * more likely they'll be "lore checks"
* Solve in any order  
  * ambitious me would make you need lore from another room to solve each step
  * so ochre phase one gives lore to solve sapphiric phase one which gives lore to solve irresolution, and so forth
* each area will be an exploration of an emotion
* two areas focused on "confluence"  
  * Ochre Plinth - Nostalgia
  * Sapphiric Matrix - Awe
* two areas focused on "dissolution"  
  * Irresolution Engine - False Hope
  * Never Star - The path untaken?

### Structural details

*The four unlocks and "Success"*

1. Pass or Don't, can't move on without
2. Pass or Fail, can change until the end
3. Pass or Fail, no reset, no indication
4. Complete override, no reset

This leads to 16 choices total if left completely atomic. _This seems like plenty of work._

Implementing a single path logically took up 11 passages, this means I'd be looking at roughly 44 passages of content between all four paths. Removing one choice brings this down to 8 passages for a total of 32. I'd say that's worth the reduction.

*Ways to resolve ending*

* Math based  
  * Each path has two choices that matter
  * Choice one doesn't because it has to be right
  * Same with choice 4
  * This leaves 8 choices
  * Have each add 25 on success
  * Require 100 total for win

```
score:0
win (score >= 100): true
win (score < 100): false
```

## High level plot

<blockquote>Once a sea of endless infinities, a desert of infinite single conclusions is all that remains.</blockquote>

Your Universe was ending from heat death, but could maintain a point of disparity. In the process of building tools to maintain this disparity, you found this was true in all universes that followed the same rules. And all had reached the same conclusion. 

All settled on using that point to simulate a new universe in conjunction with all the other ending points. And so where there were once infinite infinities, there are now just infinite points, simulating one universe at a time searching for the reversal of heat death. Whenever an agent fails to repair a point, the current universe accelerates it's heat death and is then replaced with a smaller one to deal with the loss of possibilities.

## Artifacts

* Ochre is petrified quagma,
* Sapphiric is link to all others,
* Irresolution forces quantum separation,

### [[Ochre Plinth->ochreDoor]]

_Pantone Ochre_

The plinth is the last remaining bit of crystalline universe remaining. A once enormous chunk of big bang, frozen in a freak accident of its own force.

The process of whittling it down to its current form gave birth to empires older than themselves. To memory of the future as clear as the past. To power that scoured the sculptors from existence.

By the time it came to it's new purpose, barely enough remained to enact it.

_Now_

The Plinth is a glowing Ochre cylinder with 8 faces. Its bottom flares briefly before coming to a point. Its top is a broken chiseled plane. Shadows dim the glow, flowing upward, like smoke swirling into the sky.

It once sat upon an altar of greatest honor. Not it is bound in rings of dark metal and dim glass. Each pulse of it’s light is swallowed by nodules embedding in the rings. As it’s warm glow dims, the cold blue glow of the machines around grow.

Four monks sat in prayer around it when you found it. And without their attention it became unstable. While you found that your attention could also maintain it; it was required elsewhere. So you found a way to bind them in service elsewhere (irresolution engine).

_What is wrong?_

* The Monks have turned away - Irresolution Engine
* Hope/Belief is key - The Never Star
* Flow has stalled - Sapphiric Matrix

### [[Sapphiric Matrix->sapphiricDoor]]

_Pantone Star Sapphire_

The Sapphiric Matrix is ancient in a way that is hard to explain. To a thing like you, history is not a line, but an onion. Actions do not lead to consequence, per se, rather actions and their consequence iterate.

So to come across a thing that does not, and cannot change, is... unnerving. A thing that in its creation enforced its being, step by step on existence, burns almost like cold iron. You remember the Being that made this. Another thing that does not iterate. A knife deep inside you.

<div style="background: #999B9B;" class="screen">
### [[Irresolution Engine->irresolutionDoor]]

_Pantone Silver_

You stumbled upon The Irresolution Engine long before you could see its use. Wandering the sun-dense core of things, you saw it; a cool bubble in the midst of the stellar chaos around you. A pool of cold water in a long desert, you went to drink. But the water was foul.

Gazing into the pool, you could see it now; a Slavering Beast, born of collapsed arrogance, was trapped in this gem. It had been born of the bounty offered by the people that lived in its shadow, but as it reared to devour them, it was nailed to the wall behind all things, and they began their cutting.

When they were done, they had ensured that their sphere would never fall to the universe or the ravages of time. They weren't there when you arrived, but its bones still served them.

### [[Never Star->neverDoor]]

_Pantone Ultra Violet_

Once upon a time you shared this nursery with countless stars. It was warm, and bright, and you didn't need memory.

Once upon a time you shared this home with 1e+24 stars. The skies glittered with their light, and glowed in the warmth of their cradles, and you learned and built.

Once upon a time you shared this place with 1e+12 stars. You felt cold, and with desperation realized your memory was fading.

Now all that is left is the memory you stole and hid away. And without it, there would be nothing at all.

## Endings

Ideally I'll have four endings, but I think it's import to start focused on TWO.

*Initial Endings*

* Pass - Maintain the status quo
* Fail - Your universe ends

*Second Revision endings*

* Win - Establish a new system
* Lose - All universes end


:: wakingUp {"position":"2550,2400","size":"100,100"}
A string somewhere inside your core vibrates, {reveal link: '~~"activating repair routines."~~', passage: 'wakeUpTwo'}


:: wakeUpTwo
~~"activating repair routines."~~ As it settles into a line once more, tiny bolts of lighting trace across your self; your body coming to life.

The first wave brings {reveal link: 'a sensation of discomfort', text: 'an image of a wide snowy expanse beneath a dark sky; in the distance a fire burns in the cover of a drift, resting under the fingers of a barren tree. You feel cold'}. 

The second wave to pass brings {reveal link: 'a feeling of restriction.', text: "a memory of a little boy, shoving a box into a too-small a bag. The bag threadbare, pulling at its seams, the material of the box creaking under the strain. You have form, and borders."}

The third wave is the most powerful yet, {reveal link: "the inside of you wrenches and somehow tries to escape.", text: "like trudging through something cold and viscous; things tear at your core and dig into your feet as you push forward, head held just above the foul smelling ichor. The smell is overwhelming."}

{reveal link: 'Then...', passage: 'eyesOpen'}

Machinery whirs and drones, interrupted by the occasional hiss of steam, or beep from one of the four control consoles positioned around the room. Fog on the floor flows in eddies at your passage.

Each console is set before the door of artifact they monitor. Four meter high triangles of dark brushed metal frame interlocking patterns of gold and silver hexagons, each forming a different symbol in its center. Two along the West wall:

> [["Irresolution Engine"->irresolutionDoor]]

And two along the East:

> [["Never Star"->neverDoor]]


:: eyesOpen {"position":"2550,2550","size":"100,100"}
Then a single burning point flickers in the center of your mind. Wavering, solidifying, and finally expanding; washing away the inky black void.

The interlocking panels on the plinth vault doors form a pentadecagon, a line dividing its top two thirds from its bottom, its upper portion decorated with a stylization of broken stones beneath a 7 pointed star. A light breeze flows from the wall, pushing back the fog.
{reveal link: "And something tickles inside you.",
        text: "_The image of a temple, draped in red flowers, towering above a golden plain, forms in your mind, as the scent of their pollen washes over you._"}

The console to the left of the doorway beeps at regular intervals along with a flashing icon in the center of the screen. An entry crystal to its right glows blue, safe to enter.

     passage: "contradictoryVision"}

The console to the left of the doorway beeps every ten seconds. Eight times. Then every five seconds three. Then ten and eight again. The entry crystal to its right glows orange, this place could never be trusted.

The doors to The Never Star's Rest come to form a 1m triangle in the center of the larger gateway, within that a 21 pointed star is centered, a perfect circle at rest within it. 
{reveal link: "Something cold in your core strains.",
        text: "Something cold in your core bursts out, as if trying to join its partner. _You remember standing atop a spire, above infinity, stretching down through creation and beyond. Vision locked onto the shimmering impossibility before you. Desperate need filling your self that was._"}

The console to the left of the doorway glows blue, shifting diagrams and text in green and purple cycle along the display. The entry crystal to its right glows blue, safe to enter.

It takes a while to adjust to your newly found vision. Slowly the burning blindness refines itself into colors and lines. You become aware of a hissing noise, just as it settles.

**_POP! CRHRSSSssss_**

The round shell of your capsule bursts outwards and up, and you pull yourself out of the stasis chamber. Your body takes a moment to verify its locomotor functions, crouching, jumping, touching, grabbing, before passing control directly to you.

The room surrounding your statis chamber is 20 meters square, and uncomfortably warm. The temperature difference between it and your pod covers the floor with fog. Dim blue and pink lights embedded into the concrete walls along the ceiling and floor illuminate your surrounds and make the fog glow, turning off and on, arrhythmic and slow. The air is filled with the smell of rot barely covered by harsh chemicals.

A voice, the string from before, comes from the ceiling:

At the heart of the machinery channeling the plinth's energies lies the linkage to reality alteration systems. It seems that the tidal forces emanating from its destination had unset the channel; placing it into a neutral position.

You will have to realign it with the correct source in order to restore full functionality to the system, but doing so will fuse the channel again, and you lack the power to undo such a choice.
