# colorTest

This is a tool that I'm building in order to help develop color schemes for my terminals.

## TODO

1. Make a single hex/rgb converter function  
  a. rgb values need to have spaces corrected
  b. need to get better about reusing it throughout
2. Switch to my own colors instead of Solarized
3. Pick top colors (thinking 5, 2 backgrounds + 2 forgrounds + 1 cursor)
4. Implement a color picker of some sort  
  a. [Iro.js](https://iro.js.org/) looks really slick, but might be over the top
  b. I might also be able to use [w3color.js](https://www.w3schools.com/lib/w3color.js) based on the this ["example"](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp)
