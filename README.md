# colorTest

This is a tool that I'm building in order to help develop color schemes for my terminals.

## TODO

1. Switch to my own colors instead of Solarized
2. Implement a color picker of some sort  
  a. [Iro.js](https://iro.js.org/) looks really slick, but might be over the top  
  b. I might also be able to use [w3color.js](https://www.w3schools.com/lib/w3color.js) based on the this ["example"](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp)
  
## Weird Asides

This readme's markdown was checked using the [tmpvar markdown previewer](http://tmpvar.com/markdown.html).

While I technically completed the old item 3, I'm not really sure about the solution =/

```Pick top colors (thinking 5, 2 backgrounds + 2 forgrounds + 1 cursor)```

I really need to start consulting this BEFORE I start working on a thing.
