# colorTest

This is a tool that I'm building in order to help develop color schemes for my terminals.

## TODO

1. Make a single hex/rgb converter function  
  a. rgb values need to have spaces corrected
  b. need to get better about reusing it throughout
2. Switch to my own colors instead of Solarized
3. Fix float:left behavior for inline-blocks  
  a. Comments instead of weird div wrapping?
