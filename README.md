# colorTest

This is a tool that I'm building in order to help develop color schemes for my terminals.

## TODO

1. Make a single hex/rgb converter function  
  a. rgb values need to have spaces corrected
  b. need to get better about reusing it throughout
2. Switch to my own colors instead of Solarized
